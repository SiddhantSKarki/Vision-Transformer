// This Project follows the design patterns used by LLM.c
// which can be found on https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/tree/master.
// In this project, we introduce you ViT.c, a low level image detection model
// which reprocduces the results by the paper "An Image is worth 16x16 words:
// Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale".
// This project is being built to encourage the idea of using langauges like C,
//  in a very constrained manner to achieve optimal minimum for a DNN faster
// than the implementations done in python.
